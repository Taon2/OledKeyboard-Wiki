**Software Progress**
Software worked with the Hardware team and successfully managed to get a physical keypress on a breadboard to type a letter on the computer. Work was also done in the UI regarding image brightness, an About page, and automatic layout swapping based on the focused application.

**Hardware Progress**
Work has been completed with the PCB design and with communicating with the keys to the Pi.

#### Worked on:
- Finished brightness modification
- Had to resolve the slider not having the right values
- Optional option to handle on-demand brightness values when pulling from the key config. No additional memory usage with this method
- Fixed some internals regarding the way we managed the bitmap
- More testing on config, unhappy with either of the methods tried but both are still an improvement. Going to iterate
#### Comments:
Put work off for break then got minimal work done during break. Still put in the time to finish a trickier pbi.

#### Worked on: 
- Pressing a physical key will type a letter on the computer (worked on this with Muize)
- Found a reliable way to detect the focus application on the computer for automatic layout switching
- Began working on selecting the application for a layout in the layout options, but likely will need to be pushed to the next sprint.
