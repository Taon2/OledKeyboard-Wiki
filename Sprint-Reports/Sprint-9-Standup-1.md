**Software Progress**
Software focused on tidying up some things found during our Usability experiment (mostly UI and QoL improvements). There is more work in this sprint to be done on the interface improvements, and that work is under way. Also began working on making a designated installer for the program. 

**Hardware Progress**
Hardware worked on further designing the way to connect the OLEDs to the PCB, as well as work on the keyboard matrix through soldering parts together.
