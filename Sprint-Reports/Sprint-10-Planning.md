# Sprint goal - A short description of what the team plans to achieve by the end of the sprint
The goal of this sprint is to touch up certain parts of the UI and functionality of the program. On top of that, we want to do a proof of concept or even begin pressing keys on the C# application side from the hardware switches. We are also finishing up the OLED PCB design and sending it in to get it made.
