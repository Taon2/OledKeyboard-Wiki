# Sprint goal - A short description of what the team plans to achieve by the end of the sprint
Touch up UI, get it communicating with hardware, and get the hardware prototypes up and running.

# PBIs
#1383 - 4 Effort - Zach
Pulling over from last sprint. Multiple issues found on internals and this attempts to fix those and the original goal

#1464 - 15 Effort - Christian
Sending the images to the Pi through USB COM. The Pi already sends data to the Computer, now need to send from Computer to Pi. Also need to verify the format for the images is correct for the OLEDs.

#1469 - 3 Effort - Muize
With the large number of OLED's in the overall design, there needs to be assurance that it can be powered.
Business Value: Ensures that power consumption is not too high to require additional circuitry. 

#1490 - 3 Effort - Muize
Prepare the Pi code for all of the Row/Col keypresses to send the correct character over the USB COM.

#1378- 10 Effort - Noah
Change exe selection UI element from text box to button opening file dialog. Also select the application for that layout and detect when it is focused. Detecting the focus application is done and reliable. A button needs to be added to the layout options to select the layout that will automatically apply it.
Business Value: Creates a more user friendly UI that is easy to debug and doesn't crash/fail silently.

#1479 - 7 Effort - Jaden
This PBI is intended to verify that the PCBs are working as intended, assemble the PCBs with our components, and connect the raspberry pi to start assembling for our Final presentation. 

#1484 - 4 Effort - Jaden
This PBI is just a reminder to get the Keycaps for the OLEDs printed. The Keycap is already designed and ready to be printed. Need to test with one and make sure that they fit properly, then print the rest of the keycaps
