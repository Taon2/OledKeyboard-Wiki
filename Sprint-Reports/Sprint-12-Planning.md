**Sprint goal - A short description of what the team plans to achieve by the end of the sprint**
The goal for Sprint 12 is to have all hardware entirely assembled, begin running the code on the hardware, and verify all functionality is working as intended. The end goal of this sprint is to have at least half of the hardware functioning as expected when integrated with the code.

**PBIs**

#1547 - 5 Effort - Noah
Move the location of the slider from the individual key editing screen to the layout settings screen. Change how the brightness is stored to reflect this changer in UI.
Business Value: Creates a more user friendly UI that is easy to debug and doesn't crash/fail silently.

#1654 - 15 Effort - Christian
Now that the hardware is being assembled, test the code to make sure the images are applied to each OLED in the matrix. This will essentially prove the final functionality of the keyboard.

#1650 - 10 Effort - Muize and Jaden
This is among the final tasks for the project, where we are putting all of the pieces together for the PCB and soldering everything together. Once this is done, the Pi connections can be added and the final product will be ready to be tested.
