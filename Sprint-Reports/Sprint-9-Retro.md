**Team Start:**
- In order to keep improving the team should start pushing commits more often while working on a project in order to make rollbacks easier when necessary.

**Team Continue:**
- Communicating back and forth in Teams about parts, progress, and next steps. We have been communicating clearly about new meeting times as well.

**Team Stop:**
- Some of us leave a lot of work for the weekend. While the weekend is a great time to work hard on the project, this means little progress is done over the week. This could be spread out more.
