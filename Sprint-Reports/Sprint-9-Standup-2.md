**Software Progress**
The software team finalized the UI design this sprint. The UI elements were rearranged and modified to make the UI more intuitive and pleasant to look at. The option to upload an icon for the sidebar was also added. An installer for the entire program was also successfully generated.

**Hardware Progress**
Switch function was verified and input from the switches was started as well. Some early design decisions on the PCB design were also decided.
